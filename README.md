# Introduction-to-Algorithms

## Introduce Origin of this library
Some implementations of the topics in Introduction to Algorithms and some reflections on the content of the book, if there is anything wrong, please correct me.
#

## Preliminary preparation

Before implementing and understanding this book, we need to have some mathematical foundation, and some tools to run our code.

We choose python to implement various algorithms, and we will also use some TS languages. If there is a need later, we will use more languages(most likely TS) to implement.
#
## Environmental preparation

For a better user experience, we will install some version management and running environment/running tools.

We will also add some testing tools in the future for a better learning experience

Just google it and install.

If you need to add new languages later, please add them to the list below according to the format: version manager; running environment; running tools (if the running environment is already installed, such as js and ts)

If there is none, it will be empty and separated by ";"

python: pyenv; python;

js: nvm; node;

ts: ;node; ts-node
