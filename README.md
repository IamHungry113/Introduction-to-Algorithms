# Introduction-to-Algorithms

## Introduce Origin of this library
Some implementations of the topics in Introduction to Algorithms and some reflections on the content of the book, if there is anything wrong, please correct me.

## Preliminary preparation

Before implementing and understanding this book, we need to have some mathematical foundation, and some tools to run our code.

We choose python to implement various algorithms, and we will also use some TS languages. If there is a need later, we will use more languages(most likely TS) to implement.
